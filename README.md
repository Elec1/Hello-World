# Hello-World
First Project
I am and electrical engineer.  I just installed Ubuntu after watching a YouTube video  about Hopping on The Can Bus.
I hope to use SocketCan or whatever works to study what is going wrong with my 2011 Nissan Titan.
I know there is open source code available on HitHub thatcan help me.
